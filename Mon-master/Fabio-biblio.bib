  abstract = {Distributed recycling via additive manufacturing (DRAM) emphasizes an emerging approach to locally recycle waste plastic by 3D-printing it into valuable products. Although major progress has been reported in the last decade to validate the technical feasibility, and economic viability of the DRAM as an unitary operation, the environmental evaluation of this approach is still at its early stage as a distributed recycling network. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the environmental impact of a DRAM unit as a baseline scenario, compared to two scenarios of the virgin supply chain plastic filament used in the printing process. To achieve this goal, a comparative environmental performance using a life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed to estimate the multidimensional potential impacts of virgin and recycled polylactic acid (PLA). The study takes place using a physical recycling demonstrator developed at a university in Nancy, France. Four impact categories were considered: climate change, potential eutrophication (Freshwater and Marine), resource depletion (Fossil and Water), and ion radiation. For the first three impact categories, the results demonstrate a minimum 97\% reduction in environmental impact compared to a virgin supply chain. However, in terms of ion radiation, the amount of emissions is approximately 2.8 times higher than that of the virgin plastic scenario. This increase is mainly due to the specific situation in France, where most of the energy is generated using nuclear means. This study aims to expand on the environmental assessment of the plastic recycling network system to better understand the implementation of these systems for waste plastic management, which can help extend the lifetime of plastic material. The findings provide an environmental overview of the benefits and disadvantages of developing a DRAM system in a particular context.},

  abstract = {Polymer recycling is a way to reduce environmental impacts of accumulation of polymeric waste materials. However, low recycling rates are often observed in conventional centralized recycling plants mainly to the challenge of collection and transportation for high-volume low-weight-polymers in conventional centralized recycling plants. As the democratization of open-source 3D printers is going forward thanks to initiatives such as FabLab environments, there is a growing interest on how to use this technology to improve the efficiency of use of raw materials. Studies have been proposed in order to recycle waste polymer into open-source 3D printer feedstock. The recycling of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) issued from bottles of used milk jugs through use of an open-source filament fabricator system called RecycleBot has been evaluated. In this study, we propose an evaluation of the mechanical recyclability of Polylactic Acid (PLA), material widely used in the open-source 3D printing context, in order to establish the viability of this recycled material to be used in the open-source 3D printers. The degradation of the material’s mechanical and rheological properties after a number of cycles of multiple extrusion and printing processes is evaluated. The characterization of recycled raw materials for open-source 3D printing has implications not only to reduce the environmental impact of polymers waste, but also it will allow us to understand the technical requirements and challenges for development of open-source filament recycle machine/process. The coupling of open-source 3D printers and filament extruders can offer the bases of a new distributed polymer recycling paradigm, which reverses the traditional paradigm of centralizing recycling of polymers where is often uneconomic and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. Moreover, this characterization also will allow the exploration of new source of materials and new composite materials for open-source 3D printing, in order to improve the quality of products made by this technology.},

  abstract = {© 2017 Elsevier B.V. Nowadays, the low recycling rate of polymers is still a challenge to humankind due to energy, economic and logistical issues. In the context of additive manufacturing, there is an exponential use of thermoplastic materials in the industrial and public open-source additive manufacturing sector, leading to an increase in global polymer consumption and waste generation. However, the coupling of the open-source 3D printers with polymer processing could potentially offer the basis for a new paradigm of distributed recycling process. It could be a complementary alternative to the traditional paradigm of centralized recycling of polymers, which is often uneconomical and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. In order to achieve this goal, a first step is to prove the technical feasibility to recycle thermoplastic material intended for open-source 3D printing feedstock. The contribution of the present study is twofold: first, a general methodology to evaluate the recyclability of thermoplastics used as feedstock in open-source 3D printing machines is proposed. Then, the proposed methodology is applied to the recycling study of polylactic acid (PLA) material addressed to the fused filament fabrication (FFF) technique, which is currently the most widely used. The main results of this application contribute to the understanding of the influence of the material's physico-chemical degradation on its mechanical properties as well as its potential distributed recyclability.},

This concept of Distributed Recycling via Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) is related to the use of recycled materials by means of mechanical recycling process in the 3D printing process chain. This paper aims to examine the current advances on thermoplastic recycling processes via additive manufacturing technologies. After proposing a closed recycling global chain for DRAM, a systematic literature review including 92 papers from 2009 to 2019 was performed using the scopus, web of science and springer databases. This work examines main topics from six stages (recovery, preparation, compounding, feedstock, printing, quality) of the proposed DRAM chain. The results suggested that few works have been done for the recovery and preparation stages, while a great progress has already been done for the other stages in order to validate the technical feasibility, environmental impact, and economic viability. Potential research paths in the pre-treatment of recycled material at local level and printing chain phases were identified in order to connect the development of DRAM with the circular economy ambition at micro, meso and macro level. The development of each stage proposed using the open source approach is a relevant path to scale DRAM to reach the full technical potential as a centerpiece of the circular economy.},

  abstract = {Plastic waste is a major challenge for policy making; it has a terrible impact on the environment if it is not properly managed. In order to mitigate this issue, recycling industries have emerged with the associated logistics chain that also has an environmental impact, notably with the production of greenhouse gas. In addition to using energy to transform plastic waste into source material, energy is also wasted to transport it. In parallel to reducing plastic waste, it may be recycled at a very local scale, reducing transportation and allowing potential improvement of the collecting process. Assuming that local transformation of plastic waste is possible, this article describes the design, assembly, and setup of the hardware, system architecture, and software of collectors that may be used by these recycling units. The specificity of these collectors is that they produces on-line data related to the quantity of waste collected. Once implemented, a network of smart collectors should allow the reduction of travel to collect waste as it notifies when the collectors are full. It also produces data on the scale of a territory to optimize the supply chain related to plastic waste collection. This article presents the design and engineering aspects as well as limitations induced by technical choices, but also potential improvements for future developments.},

  abstract = {3D printing is considered a disruptive technology and it continues to expand the design space boundaries for prototypes and final products. Sustainability is one of the major objectives for manufacturing, and the use of recycled materials is becoming a relevant sustainability strategy, particularly for improving material resource efficiency. This paper evaluates the suitability of substituting virgin polylactic acid (PLA) for recycled PLA. It describes an experimental plan divided into three phases to evaluate the specimens’ tensile strength. The results showed that recycled PLA could be used thanks to a similar tensile strength, even though this is slightly lower than that of the virgin material. In addition, the infill density and the orientation parameters played a major role in the response. As the infill density approaches 100\%, both the maximum load and tensile strength increase sharply. However, when using an infill density of 40\%, on average, the specimen resists 58.07\% of the maximum load. In addition, because of the anisotropy, the horizontal orientation allowed attaining a higher tensile strength while the vertical orientation provided a lower value. These are relevant insights for prescriptions of the 3D-printing parameters guaranteeing minimum tensile strength in prototyping.},

  abstract = {Since the beginning of the XXI century, we can recognize that several technical (r)evolutions have changed the way we conceived our world. New realities have appeared thanks to the information and communication technologies (e.g. Internet), peer-to-peer dynamics (e.g. open software/hardware, collaborative economy), new means of production (fablabs, hackerspaces), among others. One of the impacts of this technical ecosystem is the individual's empowerment that changes the relationship between consumer and producer. For instance, we observe an evolution of role passing from a passive consumer towards an active prosumer, where this latter considers not only economic aspects, but also social and environmental issues.This thesis is integrated in this global issue; indeed, throughout the manuscript we analyze about the impact of open-source (OS) Additive Manufacturing (AM) (also as known as open-source 3D printing or just 3D printing) in the light of the sustainability issues. The democratization of OS AM and the creation of spaces for co-creation (e.g. FabLabs) proved the interest for changes in the established roles. Therefore, we are interested in how this OS technology could develop sustainable waste management options through a polymer recycling process. In a first phase, we present the concept of additive manufacturing (AM) and its importance on sustainability issues. A systematic literature review related to the material recycling advances in the commercial and open-source (OS) AM is developed with a focus on thermoplastic polymer recycling.In a second phase, our aim is to validate open-source AM systems as a reliable manufacturing tool. We develop and test an experimental protocol in order to evaluate the dimensional performance using as case study a representative OS 3D printer: called FoldaRap. It was found that the International Standard Tolerance Grade of this machine is situated between IT14 and IT16. We conclude that the dimensional performance of this case study is comparable to the commercial AM systems, taking into account the important different in terms of machine cost. In a third phase, we center our attention on the recycling process and we propose a systematic methodology to evaluate the feasibility of the use of recycled thermoplastic polymer in OS 3D printers. A case study is developed with the evaluation of the recycling process using polylactid acid (PLA). The results allow us to conclude that the use of recycled PLA is technically feasible. Nevertheless, the degradation of the material is more important than in other traditional manufacturing systems (e.g. injection). Finally, we concludes and propose as perspectives, the study of a distributed recycling process for other type of polymers},

  abstract = {The development and implementation of recycling networks seems to be a promising way to cope with and mitigate the environmental problems of waste. As a mandatory condition, recycling networks must guarantee the achievement of sustainability requirements. Since the first proposal of the TBL (Triple Bottom Line) in the early 1990s, some authors have suggested that this model should be extended to include more dimensions. Recent studies have proposed that for a system to be sustainable, it should not only include the economic, environmental, and social dimensions but must also consider technological and political aspects and their subsequent sustainability indicators for their evaluation. In regard to recycling networks, however, social, technological, and political dimensions are still to be formalized to facilitate their use when designing recycling networks or evaluating their impact. In order to understand how these social, political, and technological dimensions should be integrated into the sustainability evaluation process of a potential recycling network, a systematic literature review has been conducted. A total of 160 journal articles were selected and analyzed. Information was identified on the problem addressed, the recycling domain, the methodologies used, and the social, technological, and political aspects under consideration. A set of social, political, and technological indicators to be considered for the main recycling network problems (design and planning, decision-making and performance evaluation, provider selection, price, and coordination) is then proposed. The main contribution of this work lies in the understanding for future research of how to consider social, political, and technological aspects taking into account the most common problems addressed in a recycling network. At the same time, findings and research gaps have been derived from these results. This study provides a basis for future work oriented toward the holistic evaluation of sustainable recycling networks.},

In terms of vibration properties, a good reproducibility of the FFF process and the vibration test was achieved. It was found that raster angle significantly affects both resonant frequency (16.6\%) and loss factor (7.5\%). The impact of the other three parameters is relatively low (less than 4\%). All these results provide guidance for further application of FFF in the vibration field.},
